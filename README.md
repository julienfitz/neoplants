# Neoplants!

Like Neopets, but for plants!

SETUP:

1. clone the repo
1. run `bundle install`
1. run `rails s`
1. in your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`

OBJECTIVE:

To keep your plants alive! There is no "winning", but your plants can die, which is as close to "losing" as this game gets. This is really a game about active, continuous involvement in your plant's life. It's a journey where the destination is the journey itself!
